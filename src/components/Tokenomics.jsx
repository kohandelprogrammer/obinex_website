                <p>Our tokenomics relies on a hybrid balancing technology that allows the token offer to be regulated, ensuring that the token
                    supply adapts to the project's development stage and specific market conditions, causing the token price to be remunerative
                    for investors while remaining attractive to platform users: the supply increment is balanced by token burns on each transaction.
